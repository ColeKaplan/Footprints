MIT Reality Hack    
Readme file for Footprints Project

Inspiration
We were inspired by the seamless and unburdensome AR technology of the Snap Spectacles along with their recent addition of global Anchor Points to create an experience where people can leave trails that guide others through the world just as they experienced it

The project is built with 3 featured modes of use.
Creator mode is where you can walk around and leave messages. When you leave creator mode it will save your trailhead, footprints, and messages for others to encounter.
Explorer mode allows you to connect to a nearby trail and follow it's footprints. You can view messages that were left on that trail, and leave your own for future travelers.
Searching mode highlights all nearby trailheads, footprints, and messages. From here you can start your own trail, join another, and interact with messages, moving to the other modes as necessary.
